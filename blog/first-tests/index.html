For all I know, there might still be some life left in the hard-drive. I have also managed to borrow a couple of alligator clips from jaja to discharge the CRT so I can go poking around with a little more peace of mind.</p><fig><img src=images/photo_1_2025-03-10_20-27-50.jpg alt="Exploded battery" width=400><figcaption>Thanks for the alligator clip jaja</figcaption></fig><video width=400 controls>

When powering-on then for the first time, I get a &ldquo;flup flup flup&rdquo; sound. It was pretty frightening when a computer sounds like a helicopter about to take off. The issue, initially, was how do I even go about looking up the issue? However I found <a href=https://www.leadedsolder.com/2022/08/02/magic-smoke-se-revenge.html>this</a> link of someone also fixing their Mac SE and their video sounds just like what I was experiencing. After learning that the sound was described as a &ldquo;flup&rdquo;, it turns out that the &ldquo;dead mac scrolls&rdquo; had described this phenomenon and attributed it to a dead MOSFET in the PSU. The aforementioned blog also suggests that this issue was indirectly caused by a hard-drive that was demanding too much power, causing the PSU and CRT to misbehave.</p><video width=400 controls>
<source src=videos/video_2025-03-10_20-27-50.mp4 type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>So once again I opened up the Mac SE, discharged the CRT, and unplugged the floppy drive and hard-drive. When powering-on for the second time, the flupping sound has disappeared and I get greeted with a white screen. Eventually the sad Mac icon showed up but that in turn made me very happy.</p><video width=400 controls>

I suspect the analog board and PSU needs a recapping. For the PSU, there are modern drop-in replacements online so I will go with those, and the analog board can be inspected for any cracked solder as I wait for the <a href=https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/capacitor-list-for-se-30-analog-board.5911/page-2>set of capacitors</a> to arrive.</p></div><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flex><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/blog/starting_out/>Starting Out</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/blog/intermission-peripherals/>Intermission: Peripherals</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p>Powered by
