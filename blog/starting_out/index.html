<a class=anchor href=#starting-out>#</a></h1><p>I am starting on my long and arduous (I think) journey in repairing a Mac SE FDHD. I saw a unit for sale on carousell for $150 but managed to negotiate to $90.</p><p>I decided that I wanted a piece of computing history and the joy that will come from restoring it. After a lot of deep research, figuring out if it was possible to fix certain components, what are the risks of buying an as-is Mac SE, I figured that it was possible for me to attempt most of the fixes. Just my will power, my soldering iron, and my time. When reading through forums, most posts by people requesting for help are surprisingly 2020 and later. There are many new projects to remanufacture new parts that also sprung up after 2020. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi also are fantastic tools to emulate old hardware like floppy drives and ethernet adapters.</p><p>From my research, the first thing I was immediately afraid of was the exploding PRAM batteries. The PRAM batteries are angry ticking time bombs that may leak, similar to conventional AA batteries, however these 1/2 AA batteries leak violently and aggressively. Electrolytes and acid may spray everywhere and cause serious corrosion to the logic board traces, metal shroud and case.</p><fig><img src=images/8046367953_8d904840c6_c.jpg alt="Exploded battery" width=300><figcaption>Exploded battery.

However, thankfully there are bran new drop in replacements. Specifically, the ones on Tindie that can accommodate the three possible types of PSUs. Tindie, as I found out, seems to be like the etsy of tech and modding, which I can thoroughly appreciate.</p><p>Lastly, an imploded CRT will render this entire project nullified because the only fix is to replace the whole CRT unit, which entails harvesting a CRT. However, the images on carousell make it seem like the unit is in an okay condition, so-so, not terrible.</p><fig><img src=images/vintage_macintosh_se_fdhd_unit_1737784217_4cd80f27_progressive.jpg alt="Mac SE condition" width=300><figcaption>Listing images of the Mac</figcaption></fig><fig><img src=images/vintage_macintosh_se_fdhd_unit_1737784217_e08d5058_progressive.jpg alt="Mac SE condition" width=300><figcaption>Listing images of the Mac</figcaption></fig></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p>Powered by
